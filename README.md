# RE:Flex Playground

RE:Flex Playground is primarily an experimental platform for interfaces
created for the RE:Flex Dance Pad v2. It supports the longer term 
[RE:Flex Nexus](https://github.com/ReflexCreations/Nexus) project as a place
to run new feature experiments before they're integrated into the main
codebase, in an agile format.

If using this project within your own work, you should expect no long term
maintenance, minimal tooling integration for the project, but decent code
quality nonetheless.

As with all RE:Flex Dance projects, this project is MIT licensed so use it
however you like.
